# Quantum Go Fish

Quantum Go Fish is a fascinating logic-based card game that incorporates quantum physics
principles. Here's a summary of the rules:

## Setup

- 3-5 players (optimal), each starts with 4 unknown cards
- No physical cards needed - played entirely mentally
- Deck contains exactly 4 cards of each suit, with as many suits as players

## Core Mechanics

- Players create new suits by being first to ask for them (traditionally given strange
names)
- You can only ask for suits you already have at least one card of
- When asked for a suit, you choose whether to have it or not - but this decision is
permanent

## Gameplay

- Players take turns asking others for specific suits
- If the asked player decides they have that suit, they must give one card to the asker
- If they decide they don't have it, they can never ask for that suit later
- The game involves deduction and tracking what cards others might have

## Winning

- Win by provably having all 4 cards of any suit
- Or win if all hands are determined at the end of your turn

The "quantum" aspect comes from the uncertainty principle - cards exist in superposition
until observed through questioning, and players must use logical deduction to collapse the
probability states of their hands.
